# EC2 Instance Types - Exam Notes


### 1. Instance Categories
- **General Purpose**: Balanced resources for diverse workloads.
  - Examples: `T` (e.g., T3), `M` (e.g., M5)
- **Compute Optimized**: High CPU for compute-intensive applications.
  - Examples: `C` (e.g., C5)
- **Memory Optimized**: High RAM for memory-intensive applications.
  - Examples: `R` (e.g., R5), `X` (e.g., X1), `Z` series
- **Storage Optimized**: High I/O performance for data-heavy applications.
  - Examples: `I` (e.g., I3), `D`, `H` series
- **Accelerated Computing**: GPU-enabled instances for machine learning and graphics.
  - Examples: `P` (e.g., P3), `G` (e.g., G4), `F` series

### 2. Use Cases for Each Instance Type
- **General Purpose (e.g., T3, M5)**: Ideal for web servers, application servers, and small-to-medium databases.
- **Compute Optimized (e.g., C5)**: Suitable for high-performance computing (HPC) and batch processing.
- **Memory Optimized (e.g., R5, X1)**: Best for large databases and memory-intensive applications, like SAP HANA.
- **Storage Optimized (e.g., I3, H1)**: Perfect for big data, data warehousing, and NoSQL databases.
- **Accelerated Computing (e.g., P3, G4)**: Ideal for machine learning, AI training, and graphics rendering.

### 3. Cost-Effectiveness
- **Burstable Instances (e.g., T3, T4g)**: Low-cost option with baseline performance; automatically scales when needed.
- **Spot Instances**: Up to 90% cost savings; suited for batch processing and fault-tolerant workloads.
- **Savings Plans & Reserved Instances**: Long-term cost savings for steady-state applications.

### 4. Networking Performance
- **Enhanced Networking (ENA, EFA)**: For high network bandwidth and low latency, available in select instances (e.g., C5n, P4).
- **Placement Groups**: Clustered instances for high-speed networking and latency-sensitive applications.

### 5. Storage Options
- **Instance Store** (Ephemeral): Temporary storage, data is lost when the instance stops or terminates.
- **Elastic Block Store (EBS)**: Persistent storage, ideal for databases and apps that require durable data storage.
- **IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second)**: Important for applications needing high I/O, like databases (e.g., I3 instances).

### 6. Scaling and Elasticity
- **Auto Scaling**: Automatically adjusts EC2 instances based on demand.
- **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances to increase application availability.

### 7. Security and IAM Roles
- **IAM Roles**: Securely grant permissions to EC2 instances to access AWS services.
- **SSH Key Pairs**: Required for secure access to EC2 instances; crucial to manage and secure.

### 8. EC2 Pricing Models
- **On-Demand**: Pay-as-you-go, ideal for short-term and unpredictable workloads.
- **Reserved Instances (RI)**: Significant savings for long-term (1 or 3 years) commitment; suitable for predictable workloads.
- **Spot Instances**: Ideal for interruptible workloads with cost savings up to 90%.
- **Dedicated Hosts**: Physically isolated servers for compliance and licensing needs.

# Security Groups & Classic Ports Overview

## Security Groups
Security Groups are virtual firewalls used to control **inbound** and **outbound traffic** to and from EC2 instances.

- **Inbound Rules**: Define the traffic allowed to enter the instance.
- **Outbound Rules**: Define the traffic allowed to leave the instance.
- **Stateful Nature**: Security groups are stateful, meaning that if an inbound rule allows traffic in, the response traffic is automatically allowed back out, and vice versa.

## Classic Ports to Remember

| Protocol      | Port Number | Description                               |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **HTTP**      | 80          | Unsecured web traffic                     |
| **HTTPS**     | 443         | Secured web traffic                       |
| **SSH**       | 22          | Secure Shell access for Linux instances   |
| **RDP**       | 3389        | Remote Desktop Protocol for Windows       |
| **MySQL/Aurora** | 3306     | Database access for MySQL/Aurora          |
| **PostgreSQL** | 5432       | Database access for PostgreSQL            |
