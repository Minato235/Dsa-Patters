# AWS Developer Concepts  ELB+ESG 

## **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB): The Referee**
- The **ELB** acts as the **referee**, distributing traffic (the ball) to the right players (instances) on the field.
- Types of ELBs:
  1. **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**:  
     - Like the midfield playmaker, it makes intelligent decisions (path-based or host-based routing) and sends the ball to the best-suited player (target).
     - Example: Routes `/login` to one server and `/signup` to another.
  2. **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**:  
     - The defender—handles heavy, fast-paced traffic (TCP/UDP), ensuring no delays for the game.
  3. **Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)**:  
     - The coach—guiding specialized strategies like integrating third-party appliances.

## **Auto Scaling Groups (ASG): The Substitute Manager**
- **ASGs** ensure your team always has enough players on the field (instances).  
  - If a player gets tired (an instance fails), it’s replaced automatically.  
  - If the crowd grows (increased traffic), new players are added to handle the demand.  

### Key Features:
1. **Dynamic Scaling**: Adds/subtracts players based on real-time traffic (game intensity).  
2. **Scheduled Scaling**: Adds more players for a planned event (a big match day).  
3. **Instance Refresh**: Swaps old players (instances) for fresh recruits without disrupting the match.

## **AWS Lambda: The Super-Sub Player**
- Lambda is your **super-sub**—only enters the game when needed and performs a specific task.  
- Examples:
  - When the striker (API Gateway) needs a quick assist, Lambda jumps in to execute the code.  
  - Pay only when it’s in action (no cost when sitting on the bench).

## **Amazon S3: The Locker Room**
- **Amazon S3** stores all your gear (data) securely and makes it accessible when needed.  
  - **Buckets**: Like locker spaces, they organize and store your objects (files).  
  - **Versioning**: Keeps old versions of your gear for reference.
  - **S3 Glacier**: The equipment archive for long-term storage.

---

## **AWS API Gateway: The Captain**
- The **captain** organizes all external communications, managing how fans (users) interact with the team (backend services).  
  - **REST APIs** and **WebSocket APIs** act as strategies to deliver requests and responses.  
  - Integrates with services like Lambda for processing the game plan.

---

## **DynamoDB: The Match Stats Keeper**
- DynamoDB is the **statistician**, maintaining real-time records of the game (data).  
  - **NoSQL Database**: Perfect for storing unstructured data, like live scores or player analytics.  
  - **Global Tables**: Syncs data across stadiums (regions) for fans worldwide.

---

## **Amazon SNS and SQS: The Team Communication System**
1. **SNS (Simple Notification Service)**:  
   - Acts as the **coach's announcement system**, broadcasting messages to the team or fans.  
   - Example: Notifies all players when it's halftime (event-driven messaging).

2. **SQS (Simple Queue Service)**:  
   - The **assistant coach's to-do list**, ensuring messages (tasks) are queued and processed one at a time.  
   - Example: Assigning post-game analysis tasks to the analysts.

---

## **Amazon CloudWatch: The Assistant Referee**
- **CloudWatch** monitors the match (infrastructure), ensuring everyone follows the rules (metrics and logs).  
  - Tracks player performance (CPU usage, memory) and flags issues.  
  - Alerts the referee (ELB) if something goes wrong.

---

## **AWS CodePipeline: The Match Coordinator**
- Like the **game coordinator**, CodePipeline automates the release process (game plan).  
  - Ensures that all players (code, builds, and tests) are ready and deployed seamlessly.  

---

## **Amazon RDS: The Team Strategist**
- The **strategist** manages structured information (relational databases) for the team’s tactics.  
  - Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Aurora.
  - **Multi-AZ Deployments**: Ensures strategies are available even if one stadium (AZ) is down.

---

## **AWS IAM: The Coach’s Roster**
- IAM is the **coach**, deciding:
  - **Who plays** (users/roles).
  - **What they do** (permissions).
  - **Where they play** (resources they can access).
  - Enforces MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication), like checking IDs before allowing players on the field.
