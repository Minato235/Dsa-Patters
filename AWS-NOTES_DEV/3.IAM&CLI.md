# Section 3: IAM and AWS CLI Notes

## 3.1 IAM Introduction: Users, Groups, Policies
- **Overview of IAM**: 
  - Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables secure control over AWS resource access.
  - Manages user identities, access rights, and permissions.

- **Key Components**:
  - **Users**: Individual accounts for people or applications.
  - **Groups**: Collections of users for simplified permission management.
  - **Policies**: JSON documents that define permissions attached to users, groups, or roles.

## 3.2 IAM Users & Groups Hands-On
- **Creating Users**: 
  - Utilize AWS Management Console or CLI to create IAM users.
  - Assign permissions directly or through group associations.

- **Creating Groups**:
  - Groups simplify management by allowing policy assignments to multiple users simultaneously.

## 3.3 IAM Policies
- **Policy Structure**:
  - Written in JSON format, consisting of statements defining actions, resources, and conditions.
  - **Example Policy**:
    ```json
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
          "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

- **Types of Policies**:
  - **Managed Policies**: Reusable policies that can be attached to multiple users/groups.
  - **Inline Policies**: Policies specific to a single user, group, or role.

## 3.4 IAM Policies Hands-On
- **Creating and Attaching Policies**:
  - Demonstrate creating a custom policy in the AWS console.
  - Attach the policy to users or groups as necessary.

- **Testing Policies**:
  - Use IAM Policy Simulator to test permissions and verify allowed/denied actions.

## 3.5 IAM MFA Overview
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:
  - Adds a security layer requiring a second form of verification (e.g., a code from an MFA device).
  - Protects accounts from unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised.

## 3.6 IAM MFA Hands-On
- **Setting Up MFA**:
  - Steps to enable MFA for IAM users via the AWS console.
  - Use virtual MFA apps (e.g., Google Authenticator) or hardware devices for authentication.

## 3.7 AWS Access Keys, CLI, and SDK
- **Access Keys**:
  - Comprise an Access Key ID and a Secret Access Key for programmatic access to AWS services.
  
- **SDKs**:
  - AWS SDKs are available for various programming languages for programmatic interaction with AWS resources.

## 3.8 AWS CLI Setup on Windows
- **Installation**:
  - Install AWS CLI using the MSI installer for Windows.
  - Configure with `aws configure` command to set access keys and default region.

## 3.9 AWS CLI Setup on macOS
- **Installation**:
  - Install using Homebrew: `brew install awscli`.
  - Configure via `aws configure`, similar to Windows setup.

## 3.10 AWS CLI Setup on Linux
- **Installation**:
  - Use package managers (`apt` or `yum`) for installation.
  - Run `aws configure` to set up access keys and region.

## 3.11 AWS CLI Hands-On
- **Basic Commands**:
  - Listing S3 buckets: `aws s3 ls`
  - Creating IAM users: `aws iam create-user --user-name <username>`
  - Execute commands to practice and familiarize with CLI usage.

## 3.12 AWS CloudShell
- **Overview of AWS CloudShell**:
  - A browser-based shell preconfigured with the AWS CLI for managing AWS resources easily.

## 3.13 IAM Roles for AWS Services
- **IAM Roles**:
  - Allow AWS services to perform actions on behalf of users.
  - Temporary roles can be assumed by services like EC2 and Lambda.

## 3.14 IAM Roles Hands-On
- **Creating and Assigning Roles**:
  - Steps to create an IAM role and attach relevant policies.
  - Demonstrate role assignment to an EC2 instance.

## 3.15 IAM Security Tools
- **Security Tools Overview**:
  - IAM Access Analyzer for identifying resource permissions.
  - AWS CloudTrail for monitoring and logging IAM activities.

## 3.16 IAM Security Tools Hands-On
- **Using IAM Security Tools**:
  - Demonstrate setting up IAM Access Analyzer.
  - Explore CloudTrail logs to track user activities.

## 3.17 IAM Best Practices
- **Best Practices**:
  - Implement least privilege access for users and roles.
  - Regularly review IAM users, groups, and permissions.
  - Prefer IAM roles over access keys whenever possible.

## 3.18 Shared Responsibility Model for IAM
- **Understanding the Model**:
  - AWS manages security *of* the cloud; users manage security *in* the cloud.
  - Importance of maintaining proper IAM configurations is emphasized.

## 3.19 IAM Summary
- **Key Takeaways**:
  - IAM is critical for securing AWS resource access.
  - Understanding users, groups, and policies is essential for effective IAM management.
  - Adherence to best practices ensures enhanced security.
