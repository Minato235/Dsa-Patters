# AWS-Dev Course Notes: Exam-Focused  

## **45. EBS Overview**  

### **Key Concepts**:
- **What is EBS?**  
  Persistent, block-level storage for EC2 instances.  
- **Features**:  
  - Data persists beyond instance termination (if not deleted).  
  - AZ-specific; cannot span across AZs.  
  - Automatically replicated within the same AZ.  

### **Exam Points**:  
1. **Durability**: Data redundancy in the same AZ.  
2. **EBS Use Case**: Databases, file systems, low-latency apps.  

---

## **46. EBS Hands-On**  

### **Steps to Remember**:  
1. **Create Volume**: Configure size, type, and AZ.  
2. **Attach Volume**: Attach to EC2 instance via console or CLI.  
3. **Format & Mount**:  
   - Format: `mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf`  
   - Mount: `mount /dev/xvdf /data`  

### **Exam Points**:  
- Know the commands for mounting and detaching volumes.  
- Understand how to handle data during attachment/detachment.  

---

## **47. EBS Snapshots**  

### **Key Concepts**:  
- **Snapshot**: Incremental backup of EBS volumes, stored in S3.  
- **Features**:  
  - Can restore to create new volumes.  
  - Supports cross-region copying.  

### **Exam Points**:  
1. Snapshots are **incremental** (only changed data is saved).  
2. Snapshots are **region-specific**, but can be copied across regions.  

---

## **48. EBS Snapshots - Hands-On**  

### **Steps to Remember**:  
1. **Create Snapshot**:  
   - Go to EC2 Console → Volumes → Actions → Create Snapshot.  
2. **Restore Snapshot**:  
   - Create a new EBS volume from the snapshot.  

### **Exam Points**:  
- Practice restoring snapshots to ensure familiarity with the process.  
- Understand snapshot lifecycle and cost implications.  

---

## **49. AMI Overview**  

### **Key Concepts**:  
- **Amazon Machine Image (AMI)**: Template to launch EC2 instances.  
- **Components**: OS, configurations, and software bundled with snapshots.  

### **Exam Points**:  
1. AMIs are **region-specific**, but you can copy them across regions.  
2. Know how AMIs relate to EBS volumes and snapshots.  

---

## **50. AMI Hands-On**  

### **Steps to Remember**:  
1. **Create AMI**:  
   - From an EC2 instance → Actions → Create Image.  
2. **Launch Instance from AMI**:  
   - Go to AMIs → Select AMI → Launch Instance.  

### **Exam Points**:  
- Understand the process of creating and using custom AMIs for scaling.  

---

## **51. EC2 Instance Store**  

### **Key Concepts**:  
- **Temporary Storage**: Data is lost when the instance stops/terminates.  
- **High Performance**: Ideal for temporary data like buffers or caches.  

### **Exam Points**:  
1. **Instance Store vs EBS**:  
   - Instance Store = Ephemeral, high performance.  
   - EBS = Persistent, more versatile.  

---

## **52. EBS Volume Types**  

### **Volume Types to Remember**:
1. **gp2/gp3**: General-purpose SSD; balanced cost and performance.  
2. **io1/io2**: High-performance SSD for IOPS-intensive workloads.  
3. **st1**: Throughput-optimized HDD for big data.  
4. **sc1**: Cold HDD for infrequent access and archival.  

### **Exam Points**:  
- Match workload type to volume type (e.g., databases = io1/io2, analytics = st1).  

---

## **53. EBS Multi-Attach**  

### **Key Concepts**:  
- **Multi-Attach**: Attach one io1/io2 volume to multiple EC2 instances in the same AZ.  

### **Exam Points**:  
1. Only supported on **io1/io2 volumes**.  
2. Best for applications needing shared storage in clustered setups.  

---

## **54. Amazon EFS**  

### **Key Concepts**:  
- **Elastic File System**: Scalable, managed file storage that supports multiple EC2 instances.  
- **Features**:  
  - Automatically scales based on usage.  
  - Multi-AZ access.  

### **Exam Points**:  
1. EFS supports **thousands of connections** and is ideal for shared file systems.  
2. EFS is more expensive but offers scalability and flexibility.  

---

## **55. Amazon EFS - Hands-On**  

### **Steps to Remember**:  
1. **Create File System**:  
   - AWS Console → EFS → Create File System.  
2. **Mount EFS on EC2**:  
   - Install dependencies (e.g., `amazon-efs-utils`).  
   - Mount with: `sudo mount -t efs`.  

### **Exam Points**:  
- Know the difference between mounting EFS vs EBS.  
- Understand the pricing (pay for storage usage).  

---

## **56. EFS vs EBS**  

### **Key Differences**:
- **EBS**:  
  - Block storage, tied to one instance, AZ-specific.  
- **EFS**:  
  - File storage, shared across multiple instances, multi-AZ.  

### **Exam Points**:  
1. **When to Use**:  
   - Use EFS for shared, scalable storage.  
   - Use EBS for single-instance performance.
